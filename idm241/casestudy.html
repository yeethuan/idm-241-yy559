            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This the executive summary of your case study. It allows your prospects to quickly understand the highlights of your past work without reading the entire thing. This section should include the core takeaways from all other sections including the main problem, an overview of the solution, and key results. This is typically written last, so that you can scan for the main points from each section below and summarize them into a one or two paragraph synopsis.</p>

        <!-- CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE -->
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <p>Microsoft Outlook is a widely used personal information manager designed to streamline email communication while offering robust features for scheduling, calendaring, task management, contact management, note-taking, and journal logging.</p>
            <p>However, users often face challenges such as cluttered inboxes, difficulty prioritizing important emails, and limited options for pinning messages. The interface can feel overwhelming, with hidden features and slow search functionality. Calendar issues, syncing delays, and inconsistencies across devices further hinder the user experience.</p>
            <p>This 10-week solo project aimed to address these pain points by redesigning the Outlook email interface. By incorporating thoughtful microinteractions, the goal was to create a cleaner, more intuitive, and user-friendly experience—improving navigation, prioritization, and overall usability through research, design, and development.</p>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            
            <h3>Research- Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>I began my research by analyzing Outlook's biggest competitor, Google’s Gmail, known for its clean, user-friendly design in contrast to Outlook’s rich and complex interface. I particularly focused on the minimalist layout and intuitive organization. Additionally, I explored messaging and food ordering apps for inspiration on organizing dense information into digestible chunks, aiming to improve how Outlook presents its full features while maintaining usability.</p>
            
            <h3>Research- Interviews</h3>
            <p>I then conducted interviews to collect what specific pain points were popular amnogst users.</p>
